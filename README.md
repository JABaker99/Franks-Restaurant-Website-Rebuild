# Frank’s Restaurant Website Rebuild

This project is a complete redesign and rebuild of the Frank’s Restaurant website using ASP.NET Core MVC with Razor views on the frontend and C# on the backend. The goal was to modernize the site, improve reliability, fix existing bugs, and provide real administrative tools so the restaurant can manage its own menu content.
The rebuilt site uses real restaurant photos, a clean and responsive layout, and a database-backed system that allows authorized admins to log in and update menu items without touching the code.
